## DESCRIPTION
### INTRODUCTION
This project demonstrates a complete workflow for fetching real-time weather data from a public API, processing the information, and generating insightful visualizations. The system connects to OpenWeatherMap's API, retrieves both current conditions and 5-day forecasts, structures the data using Pandas, and creates a professional dashboard using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The final output includes both raw data (CSV) and visual reports (PNG), providing a foundation for weather analysis applications.

### TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. Programming Language
- Python 3.x (Primary language for API calls, data processing, and visualization)

2. Libraries & Frameworks
- requests → For making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API
           → GET requests, JSON parsing are used
  
- pandas → For data manipulation and structuring
         → DataFrames, groupby operations are used
  
- matplotlib → For creating static visualizations
             → Subplots, text annotations are used
  
- seaborn → For enhanced and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations
          → Line plots, styling are used

- datetime → For handling timestamps in weather data
           →	Timestamp handling are used
  
3. API Used
- OpenWeatherMap API (Free tier available)
- Provides current weather data and 5-day forecasts
- Returns data in JSON format
- Rate Limits: 60 calls/minute (free tier)

4. Output Formats
- CSV File (weather_forecast.csv) → Stores processed forecast data
- PNG Image (weather_dashboard.png) → Weather visualization dashboard

### DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS
##### Local Development Setups
1. VS Code with Python Extension
2. PyCharm Professional
3. JupyterLab
   
##### Cloud-Based Alternatives
1. Google Colab Pro
2. AWS Cloud9
   
### APPLICATIONS AND USE CASES
**1. Weather Monitoring & Forecasting**
