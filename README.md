### TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. Programming Language
- Python 3.x (Primary language for API calls, data processing, and visualization)

2. Libraries & Frameworks
- requests → For making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API

- pandas → For data manipulation and structuring

- matplotlib → For creating static visualizations

- seaborn → For enhanced and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations

- datetime → For handling timestamps in weather data

3. API Used
- OpenWeatherMap API (Free tier available)

- Provides current weather data and 5-day forecasts

- Returns data in JSON format

4. Output Formats
- CSV File (weather_forecast.csv) → Stores processed forecast data

- PNG Image (weather_dashboard.png) → Weather visualization dashboard

### APPLICATIONS AND USE CASES
**1. Weather Monitoring & Forecasting**
- Personal weather tracking

- Travel planning based on forecasts

- Agriculture (Farm weather monitoring)

**2. Data Analysis & Visualization**
- Analyzing temperature/humidity trends

- Comparing weather patterns across cities

- Climate research & education

**3. IoT & Smart Devices Integration**
- Home automation (Adjusting thermostats based on forecasts)

- Smart agriculture (Irrigation control based on weather data)

**4. Business Applications**
- Retail (Demand forecasting based on weather)

- Logistics (Route planning for deliveries)

- Event management (Outdoor event scheduling)

### CONCLUSION
This task demonstrates API integration, data processing, and visualization using Python. It can be extended into a web app, automated weather alerts, or integrated with IoT systems. The skills used here are applicable in data science, backend development, and automation projects.
